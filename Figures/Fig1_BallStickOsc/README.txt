From each folder the "ErroTable" file was used to find the smallest L1 errors "kernelOut_4/ErrorL1Raw_Noise_SNR0" and the rows and columns of this value identified the basis width and lambda parameters. By using these parameters for the various setups (8,16,128) from the kernelOut_4 subfolders the reconstruction files ("kernelOut_4/skCSDall_M512_R*lambda*") were opened and used to prepare the figures.  The "sameplace.txt" shows that which specific segments (which line in the file) are the sum of the skCSD reconstructions on the locations on the curve fitted ionto the morphology.
You'll need to copy download the data folders (BS_d50_el8_CosChanging,BS_d50_el16_CosChanging,BS_d50_el128_CosChanging) in order to be able to reproduce the figures.
